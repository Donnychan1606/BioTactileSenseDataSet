The programs in the root directory are for preprocessing the dataset and can be used as needed. The function names correspond to the file names. For example, reshapeArr represents the program for reshaping arrays. The check65535 program is used to exclude potential outliers from sensor data because the sensor's output capacitance value peaks at 2 to the power of 16 (which is 65535).
